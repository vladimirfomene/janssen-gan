# Janssen GAN
This project's focus is to train a binary classifier for malaria using a Generative adversarial approach.
By this I mean, we will train a generator network that takes in negatives images as input and learn how to 
generates positive images. On the otherhand, the generator will learn how to discriminate between positive 
and negative images. At the end of the day, we will use the discriminator as our classifier. 

## How to Setup the project
You will need to download Jupyter notebook to train the classifier. It can be found at [here](http://jupyter.org/install).
Then run the code in the jupyter notebook found in this folder.
